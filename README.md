## Project Overview
`react-aptos` is a Next.js application designed to leverage the power of React with server-side rendering and static site generation. It incorporates popular libraries like Bootstrap, Framer Motion, and FontAwesome for styling and animations, along with Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling. This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Features
- **Next.js**: Framework for server-rendered React applications.
- **Responsive Design**: Styled with Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS.
- **Icons**: Integrated with FontAwesome and Lucide React for rich iconography.
- **Animations**: Powered by Framer Motion for smooth transitions and effects.
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript support for robust development.
- **Linting**: ESLint for code quality and consistency.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (version 18 or higher recommended)
- npm, yarn, pnpm, or bun

## Getting Started

### Development Server
To run the development server:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd react-aptos
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   # or
   pnpm install
   # or
   bun install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   # or
   pnpm dev
   # or
   bun dev
   ```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the result. You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

### Production Server
To run the production server:
1. Build the application:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   # or
   yarn build
   # or
   pnpm build
   # or
   bun build
   ```
2. Start the production server:
   ```bash
   npm run start
   # or
   yarn start
   # or
   pnpm start
   # or
   bun start
   ```
The production server will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). The build process optimizes the application for performance and prepares it for deployment.

## Scripts
